1. Quicksort Implementation for i-th Order Statistic:
   
Description: This task utilizes the Quicksort algorithm to develop a solution for identifying the i-th smallest element in an unsorted array.
Average Time Complexity: O(n log n)

2. Data Structures: Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List:

Description: Fundamental implementations of Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List, demonstrating the functionality of these data structures using fixed-size arrays. Each structure supports key operations, including push, pop, enqueue, dequeue, insertion, deletion, and search.
